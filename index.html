  <h2>The best band of all time</h2>
  <p>In your world you have total and absolute power. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Brown is such a nice color.</p>
  <p>You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We need dark in order to show light. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. What the devil.</p>
  <p>If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>
  <p>Here we're limited by the time we have. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.</p>
